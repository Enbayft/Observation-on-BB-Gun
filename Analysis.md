    Heavy Cruiser Guns: AP vs HE
  </h1>
</body>

## Abstract
Heavy cruisers have two main choices: armor piercing and high explosive guns. Both offer situational advantages. In majority of cases, high explosive guns work best, however, there are situations in which armor piercing guns offer better advantages. This paper will look at these two types overall and then break them down. It will also discuss, briefly, specific guns tied to specific ships.

Heavy cruiser guns (203mm) are burst-like guns in Azur Lane (AL). They are split into two categories: Armor Piercing (AP) and High Explosive (HE). When either are equipped on a heavy cruiser (CA), especially on ones which have MGM+1 (main gun mount + 1), they form the core of a DPS unit. However, which is best is highly debated. 

This paper will be talking about what makes a good CA gun and when an AP or HE-type gun is appropriate in what context. It will also discuss unique exceptions. Do note that this paper will avoid discussing on an individual CA and their performance. It is strictly focused on the guns themselves unless it is heavily tied to a ship.

## Introduction to AP and HE (skip if well-versed)
AP guns focus on pure raw damage and focused on medium armor mods (modifiers). They are typically characterized by their slow speed but high alpha damage. Thus, even if they have only a slight better mod in heavy armor, the raw damage tends to allow them to push higher in the DPS points. They also are faster than HE guns with capability of piercing. Piercing in AL means the round will not dissipate on one enemy, but will travel until hitting another or evaporating. Enemies that receive the pierced round will be dealt full damage.

Ex. Two ships are lined up in a line. A round hits the first and hits the second. The round does 50 damage. Both ships are dealt 50 damage.

HE guns are typically faster with a stronger focus on light and a weaker raw damage than AP guns. They typically make up for this with a faster reload and a great affinity against light armor and mediocre in medium and heavy.

## AP v. HE
One of the greatest debates in AL is on what a CA should equip. There are many reasons why one might prefer AP and where one might prefer HE. Outside of where ship girls have a skill that enhances a shell type, there isn’t one single “best” round type. While yes one of these will perform the best in the majority, there definitely exists situations in which the other will work.

When observing what AP offers, one may be tempted to side with it. However, the context in which these offerings are employed can result in an opposite unexpected result. The high alpha damage and focus on medium armor is a tempting offer, but the majority of the enemies are light. The pierce sounds great, but, in likelihood, one will not achieve a high enough pierce to offset the light DPS disparity.
When observing HE, one might be tempted to rely on it solely for every content. The fast reload and better mods v. light offer a tempting choice. However, there exists situations in which its lacking in raw alpha damage leaves it not optimal.

Let’s use the 203mm Triple MLE from prototype research (PR) as our staple HE gun. We will refer to it as the MLE from now on until further notice. Conversely, we will use the 203mm Triple SKC from PR, referred to as the SKC until further notice. 

The raw stats for both guns are as follows:

| Name | Firepower | Damage | Coefficient | Volley Time (s) | Reload (s) | Light Armor Mod | Medium Armor Mod | Heavy Armor Mod|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MLE | 45 | 3x52 | 130% | 0.40 | 5.39 | 135% | 95% | 70% |
| SKC | 45 | 2x3x50 | 105% | 0.50 | 7.32 | 75% | 110% | 75% |

At this point, one might prefer the SKC, but let’s pay attention to their armor mods, which are as follows:

| Name | Light Damage | Medium Damage | Heavy Damage | Light DPS | Medium DPS | Heavy DPS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MLE | 396 | 279 | 205 | 65 | 45 | 33 |
| SKC | 45 | 2x3x50 | 105% | 0.50 | 7.32 | 75% |

And we get:

Which we notice the sudden change in specialization. This is where the differences between the two types come into player. Better mods in HE guns allow them to catch up drastically. Now the two guns are fit into two defined roles.

This is where the crucial discussion lays ahead of us. We can tell that HE and AP are specialized. But which is better and when should we use one over the other? We will use a few criteria: fleet composition, enemy makeup on a map, and level advantages.
