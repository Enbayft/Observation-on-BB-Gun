## Part 1 - Air Control
When attacking, a new “air supremacy value” is displayed in the fleet selection interface. This value displays the fleet’s air-to-air combat capability. The value is determined by the fleet’s aviation value and the number of carrier-based aircraft equipped (ASW planes are not included in this value).

Enemy fleets are capable of confronting our air control. By increasing our own AA value, we can reduce the enemy’s air supremacy value.
Both the enemy’s and our own air supremacy value can affect the current state of air control. This can affect certain fleet attributes. 

Status: Air Supremacy

The fleet’s air-based damage is increased by 20%, air-based damage taken is decreased by 10%, hit is increased by 10%, and the ambush probability is decreased by 8% (fire and flooding chances are not affected).

Status: Air Control Advantage

The fleet’s air-based damage is increased by 12%, air-based damage taken is decreased by 6%, hit is increased by 5%, and the ambush probability is decreased by 5% (fire and flooding chances are not affected).

Status: Stand-Still

The fleet’s air-based damage is increased by 6%, air-based damage taken is decreased by 3% (fire and flooding chances are not affected).

Status: Air Control Disadvantage

The fleet’s air-based damage is decreased by 12%, air-based damage taken is increased by 6%, hit and evasion is decreased by 3% (fire and flooding chances are not affected).

Status: Loss of Air Supremacy

The fleet’s air-based damage is decreased by 20%, air-based damage taken is increased by 10%, hit and evasion is decreased by 8% (fire and flooding chances are not affected).

Status: Neutral Air Space

No effects.

Note 1: If the "air supremacy value" is higher than the recommended value on a given map, air supremacy is ensured.

Note 2: if a ship sinks, the value will decrease accordingly. Fleets retreating follows the same rule.

## Part 2 - New Enemies
Anti-Air Warship – The enemy will apply AA fire against friendly carrier planes within a large range.

Carrier-based airplanes can evade enemy AA fire based on their own evasion rate. 

An airplane’s own evasion rate is determined by the friendly carrier’s aviation value and the enemy’s AA value.

There is an upper-limit to the evasion rate (can be viewed on the equipment stat panel). It showcases the probability of the aircraft to evade incoming fire.

Command Ship – When present, all enemy ships’ damage is increased.

Repair Ship – There are two variants: S and A. S-type will repair a singular enemy. A-type will repair all enemies. They will make continuous repairs.

## Part 3 - Armor-Penetration Mechanics
When a battleship fires an armor-piercing round (excluding skills that add a penetration effect or has a penetration value) and it hits an enemy with heavy armor there is a chance to penetrate the armor, enemies affected by armor-penetration will take increased shell damage by a percentage.

In addition, AP damage is getting buffed against light armor enemies.
